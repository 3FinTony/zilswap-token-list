# Add New Token Logo

Please follow the below format for adding a token to the Zilswap token list.

## Checklist 

Ensure these have been done:

* [] My token address is keyed by a unique token symbol in tokens.json, matching the ZRC-2 smart contract `symbol` field exactly.
* [] I've added a 64x64 `svg` formatted logo with the filename as <token_symbol>.svg in the /logos folder.
* [] My `svg` logo has no unnecessary metadata and tags.

## Address Verification
